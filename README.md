## Project setup

Download and unzip the file

In your terminal, cd to the directory of the project file

Run the command below in your terminal
```
npm install
```

then run
```
npm run serve
```

You should be able to access the page from the link provided in the terminal


## Note
I recently found that if the project folder is placed in my desktop, the app fails to start when running
**npm run serve**

However, it runs successfully when I place it in my usual projects directory.

Therefore, in the off chance that the project fails to run, I made a short demo video unzipping, installing and running the code.
In the video, I go through the functions implemented and at the end I show the part where I failed to implement proper styling to account for page responsiveness
